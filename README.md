Mobile first Sass Mixins – based on simplicity 
===========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/macx/sass-mixins.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/macx/sass-mixins) ![Mobile first](https://img.shields.io/badge/RWD-mobilefirst-lightgrey.svg?style=flat) ![Unicorn approved](http://img.shields.io/badge/unicorn-approved-ff69b4.svg?style=flat)

There are a lot of Sass Mixins out there. Most of them are overdone,
because they want to fit for everyone – no matter if you prefer mobile first
or any other approach.

This Mixin Set from [David Maciejwski](https://plus.google.com/102458928073783517690?rel=author) and contributors is different.
It's mobile first and will only generate classes that are really needed
to do the trick.

## Features

* Highly flexible Grid with push and pull methods based on your configuration
* Effective Respond-Mixin to set `@media triggers (from, to)
* clearfix

## Installation

If you are using Bower, it's just a couple of finger tips away:

```sh
$ bower install macx-sass-mixins --save-dev
```
