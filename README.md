Mobile first Sass Mixins – based on simplicity
===========

There are a lot of Sass Mixins out there. Most of them are overdone, because
they want to fit for everyone, no matter if you prefer mobile first or
any other approach.

This Mixin Set is different. It's mobile first only and will only generate
classes that are really needed to do the trick.

## Features

* Highly flexible Grid with push and pull methods based on your configuration
* Effective Respond-Mixin to set `@media triggers (from, to)
* clearfix

## Installation

If you are using Bower, it's just a couple of finger tips away:

```sh
$ bower install macx-sass-mixins --save-dev
```
